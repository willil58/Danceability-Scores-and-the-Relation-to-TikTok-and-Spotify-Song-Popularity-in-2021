# I310-Assignment-1
I was curious how danceability scores affected how popular a song was on Spotify and TikTok and wanted to visually see how the popularity scores related to danceability on each application. I felt the best way to do this was to create a line graph.

I found the data set TikTok popular songs 2021 on the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sveta151/tiktok-popular-songs-2021?resource=download

Limitations: The data found for TikTok was on publicly open site and didn’t say whether or not TikTok themselves provided the raw data or how the data was collected. The raw data didn’t explain how danceability was calculated so it’s possible that different data sources could score danceability differently. It's important to note that this data is from 2021 and the popularity scores of songs will be different prior to and after 2021.
